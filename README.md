# ML-TOPPERS: 9-Week AI & Machine Learning Bootcamp

Welcome to **ML-TOPPERS**, a structured 9-week AI and machine learning learning repository designed to complement the  
**ML Community 2-Month Summer Roadmap (June 15 – August 15, 2025)**.

This repository contains weekly folders with well-organized homework tasks, coding exercises, and project files. Each week aligns with specific topics from the roadmap to build your data science and machine learning skills progressively.
